## Overview

Hello, my name is Ian.\
I'am a `Python/Rust` software engineer.
During career I've been in developing of `defencive systems` and `geological software` for the oil industry.
On the way, starting in 2013, I came across a wide range of tasks and solutions in the field of programming,
from the low-level `embedded programming`, drivers writing to the high-loaded `microservices`, providing `API` to computational mathematical modules.\
`Agile` methodologies, like `Scrum` and `Kanban` were actively used in the teams where I worked.\
The developed code was subject to high requirements of industry standards:

- Test coverage
- Static Code Analyzers
- Code review
- Pull requests
- CI/CD DevOps practices to deliver changes to prod as soon as possible
- Azure (ex Microsoft Team Foundation Server)
- Git commitizen, precommits
- VS Code, NeoVim, Nu Shell, Sublime Text
