## Overview

As a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience, I specialize in `Python` and `Rust`, with a proven track record in developing high-performance systems across various industries including `defense` and `oil & gas`. My expertise spans from low-level embedded programming to high-load microservices and APIs for complex computational modules. I am adept in `Agile` methodologies (`Scrum`, `Kanban`) and committed to best practices in software development, including:

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Static code analysis
- Code reviews
- Pull request workflows
- CI/CD DevOps practices
- Proficiency with Azure DevOps, Git commitizen, pre-commit hooks
