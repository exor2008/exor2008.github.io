## Overview

Hello, my name is Ian.\
I'am a `Python/Rust` software engineer with experience in developing `defensive systems` and `geological` software for the `oil industry`.
Since 2013, I have tackled a wide range of programming tasks and solutions, 
from low-level `embedded programming` and drivers writing to high-load `microservices`, providing `API` to computational mathematical modules.\
I am well-versed in `Agile` methodologies like `Scrum` and `Kanban` and have consistently adhered to high industry standards, including:

- Test coverage
- Static Code Analyzers
- Code review
- Pull requests
- CI/CD DevOps practices to deliver changes to prod as soon as possible
- Azure (ex Microsoft Team Foundation Server)
- Git commitizen, precommits
- VS Code, NeoVim, Nu Shell, Sublime Text
