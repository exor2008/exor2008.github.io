    - title: Yard Planning
      description: |
        I've been expanding the functionality of the <code>Yard Planning</code> software - 
        web framework for managing the arrival, storage and departure of vehicles.
        Ability to quickly change the state of <code>hundreds of VIN</code> numbers in a single operation has been added, 
        instead of processing each number individually.

    communications, <code>automated control systems</code>, instrumentation and control systems 
    of Gazprom Neft and SIBUR to serve the needs of business partners in the field of information technology.
  projects:
    - title: Comprehensive assessment of geological knowledge.
      description: |
        The project is a plug-in to another internal product - <code>Geomate</code>.
        The plugin allows a geologist to evaluate the geological study of the deposit and plan its further development. 
        The assessment is based on a set of geological studies: logging, 2D/3D seismics, waterlogging, 
        sand/clay index, natural radiation level. 
        Many <code>optimization algorithms</code> have been applied to solve the problem, including a 
        <code>Genetic algorithm</code> to find the optimal position for a new exploration well.
      stack:
        - Python
        - SciPy/numpy

    - title: Spectral Geomodeling
      description: |
        The project is a plug-in to the famous geological software - <code>Schlumberger</code>.
        The plugin allowed a geologist to calculate a three-dimensional cube of rock for 
        any geological property (logging, sand / clay) based on a set of geological data, 
        such as: rock layers, wells and studies conducted on them.
        The result is an interpolation of the interwell space based on the <code>spectral-basis method</code>.

    - title: Mobile API
      description: |
        The task was to develop an <code>API</code> for mobile applications (IOS, Android) 
        of the already existing website of the Salavat Yulaev hockey team from Ufa, 
        sponsored by Gazprom-Neft. The site is based on the <code>Django</code> framework, 
        so the Django API and the entire rich ecosystem of this framework, 
        including django <code>ORM</code>, were chosen to solve the problem.
      stack:
        - Django
        - Python
        - PostgreSQL

    - title: Geonavigator
      description: |
        Development of the <code>Spectral Geonavigation</code> project.
        This time, the task was to support the drilling operation in real time. 
        Using the Spectral Geonavigation algorithm, a 2D slice is constructed along 
        the drilling axis and interwell space is calculated. The section is constantly 
        being rebuilt as the drill progresses and updated information is received.
        The project is a self-contained <code>client-server</code> solution. 
        A <code>GPU shader</code> has been developed for the client to 
        display geological data in high resolution in real time.

    - title: Geomate 3.0
      description: |
        Further evolution of geomate software. Geomate is becoming a <code>web-based platform</code>.
        My team's tasks included the development of a <code>microservice</code> for storing and processing
         3D seismic data. Such data can be of impressive size, one cube is about <code>100 GB</code>. 
         It was required to provide slices of such cubes in various configurations in <code>real time</code>. 
         The final product was a set of <code>Docker</code> images on <code>Red Hat Linux</code>.
