  long_description: |
    A lamp based on an LED matrix running <code>Raspberry Pi Pico</code>. 
    Designed for manufacturing from widely available materials. 
    The firmware is written in the <code>Rust</code> language using the asynchronous 
    framework for embedded programming <code>Embassy</code> (Embedded Rust). 
    A driver has been written for the <code>ws2812b</code> LED device, 
    as well as the <code>APDS-9960</code> gesture sensor. Bit-banging 
    protocols are implemented using coprocessor programming (<code>PIO</code>) 
    in a specialized <code>assembly language</code>, which makes them stable and time-accurate.
    You can assemble one for yourself. Firmware and wiring scheme are free and available via <code>github</code> link.
